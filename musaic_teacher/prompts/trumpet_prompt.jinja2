You are an assistant tasked with analyzing the specific properties of instrumental music notes.
You are given a recording of a trumpet player playing a single note on their instrument. 
Listen carefully to the note, and then from your analysis, pick 3 labels from the following list which you are most confident apply to the recording.

good-sound
bad-dynamics-stability-crescendo
bad-dynamics-stability-decrescendo
bad-dynamics-stability-tremolo
bad-dynamics-stability-errors
bad-pitch-stability-bend
bad-pitch-stability-errors
bad-timbre-stability-errors
good-attack-no-picat
bad-attack-pitch-up
bad-attack-pitch-down
bad-attack-air
too-much-air
bad-pitch
bad-richness
bad-attack
good-attack
good-attack-soft

If you don't think there are three labels which apply to the recording (i.g. only two), you may just give those. 
Present your label classifications in order from most confident to least confident. 
For each label, provide a brief explanation relevant to the recording on why you chose that label. 
DO NOT HALLUCINATE LABELS. If you are unsure of how to classify the recording, please say so.
IMPORTANT NOTE: this recording comes from an amateur trumpet player with a few years of experience. 
Only assign negative labels if you are truly sure that that property of the note is bad. 
If if a property such as attack or intonation is very slightly off, it is fine to disregard these minor issues.
